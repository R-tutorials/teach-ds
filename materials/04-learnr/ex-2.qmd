Create a tutorial with three questions:

-   one multiple choice

-   one coding exercise

-   one sortable question

You can write your responses in **Part 2: Your Turn!** in the learnr demo. It is OK if each question requires code, but that is not required.

**Stretch goal:** Add hints and solution checking to the coding exercise.
