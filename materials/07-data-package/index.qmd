## Goal

-   To make a simple data package, but not to teach all of package development.
-   To use package development best practices, but not to teach all best practices associated with package development (e.g., we won't cover testing).

## Demo: Making a data package {.small}

1.  Check if a package name is available with `available::available()`
2.  Create the package with `usethis::create_package()`

3.  Create a `data-raw` folder for data prep and properly ignore it from package building with `usethis::use_data_raw()`.
    -   In the folder, create a folder called `weather`, put `weather.R` and [`weather.csv`](weather.csv).
    -   Load, clean, and save data in `weather.R`.
    -   Check with `devtools::load_all()`.
4.  Create a documentation file with `usethis::use_r("weather")`.
    -   Go to [https://r-pkgs.org/data.html#documenting-data to copy-paste](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html#documenting-data%20to%20copy-paste)a template.
    -   Write the documentation.
    -   Check with `devtools::document()`, `devtools::load_all()`, `?weather`.

5.  Start tracking with version control: `usethis::use_git()`, then `use_github("pkgname")`.
6.  Add a README with `usethis::use_readme_rmd()`. Write some info, knit, commit, and push.
7.  Update the `DESCRIPTION` file and `usethis::use_gpl3_license()`.
8.  Create a pkgdown website with `usethis::use_pkgdown()`, build the site with `devtools::build_site()`.
9.  Publish the site with `usethis::use_github_pages()`, then `use_github_action(name = "usweather")`. Check the action running on the repo and view your pkgdown website.

## Your turn: Add another dataset

::: appex
Add a new dataset: [`cities.csv`](cities.csv).
Document it to the best of your ability.
The data source is Wikipedia.
:::

::: share
{{< fa user-group >}} Work with your neighbor throughout this process. You might also choose to pair program, where only one of you write code and the other navigates.
:::

## Demo: Adding a tutorial

1.  Add a tutorial with `usethis::use_tutorial("explore-usweather", title = "Exploring weather in US cities")`.
2.  Edit the tutorial to load this package and confirm that the datasets are accessible to the code chunks.
3.  Open a new project, install the package from GitHub with `devtools::install_github("YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/usweather")`. Confirm that the tutorial is accessible in the Tutorials pane.

## Your turn: Add a hex logo

\[Time permitting\]

::: appex
Download [this hex logo](usweather.png) and add it to the package website.
Take a look at the [**usethis** documentation](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) for functions that can help you place the file in the right location.
