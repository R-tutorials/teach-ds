# Reproducibility in the classroom

## Reproducibility checklist

-   Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
-   Does the code actually do what you think it does?
-   In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done? (e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)
-   Can the code be used for other data?
-   Can you extend the code to do other things?

## Ambitious goal + many other concerns

We need an environment where

-   data, analysis, and results are tightly connected, or better yet, inseparable

-   reproducibility is built in

    -   the original data remains untouched
    -   all data manipulations and analyses are inherently documented

-   documentation is human readable and syntax is minimal

## Roadmap

-   Scriptability $\rightarrow$ R
-   Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) $\rightarrow$ Quarto
-   Version control $\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub

# Literate programming

## Why Quarto?

-   **Reproducibility:** Train new analysts whose only workflow is a reproducible one
-   **Pedagogy:**
    -   Code + output + prose together
    -   Syntax highlighting FTW!
    -   Familiar-feeling authoring with the visual editor without having to learn a bunch of new markdown syntax
-   **Efficiency:** Consistent formatting -\> easier grading
-   **Extendability:** Use with Python, and Julia, and Observable, and more

## Tips for starting with Quarto

-   Minimal YAML
-   Minimal chunk options
-   Use well scaffolded Quarto documents
-   Render early and often!
