## Setup

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)

loans <- loans_full_schema %>%
  mutate(
    homeownership = str_to_title(homeownership), 
    bankruptcy = if_else(public_record_bankrupt >= 1, "Yes", "No")
  ) %>%
  filter(annual_income >= 10) %>%
  select(
    loan_amount, homeownership, bankruptcy,
    application_type, annual_income, interest_rate
  )

loans
```

## Exercise

Using the `loans` data, create side-by-side box plots that shows the relationship between loan amount and application type, faceted by homeownership.

```{r}
#| label: boxplots-facet
